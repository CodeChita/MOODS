# MOODS :):


## Description

MOODS is an app that enables users to track their moods on a regular basis. The aim is to help people, especially those with relevant disorders, to feel more in control and aware of factors that influence their emotions.

 
## User Stories

- **404** - As a user I want to see a nice encouraging 404 page when I go to a page that doesnâ€™t exist
- **500** - As a user I want to see a nice error page when the super team screws it up so that I know that is not my fault
- **homepage** - As a user I want to be able to access the homepage so that I can easily see what the app is about and where to login and signup
- **sign up** - As a user I want to sign up without much effort to join the app. I also want to see my privacy concerns to be taken into consideration.
- **login** - As a user I want to be able to log in on the webpage so that I can get back to my account without much effort
- **logout** - As a user I want to be able to log out from the webpage so that I can make sure no one sees my account without authorisation.
